## 🧩 Game Logic

The game uses a simple but engaging mechanic where each click affects 5 tiles total:

- The tile directly below (if it exists)  
- The tile to the left (if it exists)
- The tile to the right (if it exists)

This creates interesting patterns and requires strategic thinking to solve!
